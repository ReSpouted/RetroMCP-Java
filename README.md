# RetroMCP-Legacy

RetroMCP-Legacy is a Fork of [RetroMCP-Java](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java) that adds mappings for 1.6.4.

RetroMCP Legacy is a modification of the Minecraft Coder Pack to create a "Long Term Service" patch for Minecraft.


## This is meant for the testing and development of Respouted Legacy (Oldspout)!

A patched version of Respouted Legacy (OldSpout) will be available in its own repository.

# Getting a patched version of Re:Spouted

- Download `RetroMCP-Legacy-GUI.jar` from [the latest release](https://github.com/ReSpouted/RetroMCP-Legacy/releases/latest)
- Run it in a dedicated folder, **make sure to use jdk 8**.
- select `Release 1.6.4` under the current version popup.
- Press `Decompile` (It will say `Finished with errors!`: That's expected).
- In the menu bar, press `MCP` > `More tasks...` >  `Download Spoutcraft's patch`.
- In the menu bar, press `MCP` > `More tasks...` >  `Apply patch`. *Ideally no errors would happen here*.
- Press `Recompile`. (If errors happened during this step above, this is likely to have a few errors. These are likely to be just stuff using the wrong name for a method or a variable).
- Press `MCP > Launch client`.

You'll be able to find the code in the `minecraft` folder.git
